    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as a linear, educational narrative. It starts with the absolute basics and progressively introduces more complex topics like dividends, comparisons, risks, and taxes. This top-to-bottom flow is ideal for a beginner, guiding them through the concepts logically. A sticky navigation bar allows users to jump to sections if they wish, but the primary design encourages a sequential learning path. Interactive elements like the yield calculator and the tax chart are placed directly within the relevant explanatory text to make abstract concepts tangible and immediately explorable. This structure was chosen over a dashboard because the goal is education, not data monitoring. The user journey is one of discovery and learning. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:

        - Report Info: Income vs. Growth Stock traits -> Goal: Compare -> Viz/Presentation: Bar Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Buttons to toggle view between 'Yield' and 'Growth Potential' -> Justification: Visually contrasts the fundamental tradeoff between the two stock types.
        - Report Info: Common Sectors -> Goal: Organize/Inform -> Viz/Presentation: Interactive Cards (HTML/CSS/JS) -> Interaction: Click card to reveal description -> Justification: A clean, engaging way to present categorical information without cluttering the UI.
        - Report Info: Risks -> Goal: Inform -> Viz/Presentation: Accordion/Toggle List (HTML/CSS/JS) -> Interaction: Click to expand/collapse risk explanation -> Justification: Presents critical warnings in a digestible, on-demand format.
        - Report Info: US Dividend Tax Rates -> Goal: Inform -> Viz/Presentation: Bar Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Dropdown to select filing status, which updates the chart -> Justification: Simplifies complex tax information, making it personally relevant and easy to visualize.

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Section 1: The Basics of Income Stocks</h2>
                <p class="text-stone-600 mb-6">This section introduces the core concept of an income stock. Think of it as investing for a steady paycheck rather than hoping for a one-time lottery win. We'll explain what these stocks are and why someone might choose them over other types of investments.</p>
                <div class="prose max-w-none">
                    <h3>What is a stock anyway?</h3>
                    <p>Imagine a big company is a giant pizza. Buying a stock is like buying one small slice of that pizza. You become a part-owner of the company, and you're called a shareholder.</p>
                    
                    <h3>So, what makes a stock an "Income Stock"?</h3>
                    <p>An income stock is a slice of pizza that gives you a few pepperonis every few months. In the real world, these "pepperonis" are cash payments called <span class="font-bold text-amber-600">dividends</span>. Companies that are mature and make consistent profits often don't need to reinvest all their money back into the business. Instead, they share a portion of those profits directly with their owners (the shareholders).</p>
                    
                    <div class="mt-6 bg-stone-50 p-4 rounded-lg flex items-center gap-4">
                        <span class="text-4xl">💰</span>
                        <div>
                            <h4 class="font-bold">The Main Goal: A Steady Paycheck</h4>
                            <p>The primary reason to own income stocks is to create a regular stream of income. It's similar to how a landlord collects rent. You own the asset (the stock), and it pays you periodically. This is different from "growth stocks," where the main goal is to sell your slice of pizza later for a much higher price than you paid for it (like flipping a house).</p>

                <p class="text-stone-600 mb-6">Dividends are the engine of income investing. In this section, we'll look closer at what they are and introduce a key metric called "dividend yield." To make it real, you can use our simple calculator to see exactly how dividend yield is calculated based on a stock's price and its dividend payment.</p>
                <div class="prose max-w-none mb-8">
                    <h3>What is Dividend Yield?</h3>
                    <p>Dividend yield is a simple percentage that tells you how much income (from dividends) you're getting each year in relation to the stock's price. It helps you compare the income potential of different stocks. A higher yield means more income per dollar you invest.</p>
                    <p>The formula is: <span class="font-mono bg-stone-200 p-1 rounded">(Annual Dividend per Share / Price per Share) x 100</span></p>

                        <li><strong>Dividend Kings:</strong> Even more exclusive, these are companies that have increased their dividend payouts for an incredible 50+ consecutive years.</li>

                            Dividends are not guaranteed. If a company faces financial hardship, it might reduce or even eliminate its dividend to save cash. This usually causes the stock price to drop as well.

                            When interest rates rise in the economy (like for savings accounts or government bonds), the fixed income from those safer options becomes more attractive. This can make dividend stocks look less appealing, potentially causing their prices to fall as investors shift their money.

                           Be cautious of an unusually high dividend yield! A very high yield can be a warning sign. It often happens because the stock's price has fallen sharply due to problems with the business. You might be lured in by the high yield, only to see the dividend get cut and lose your investment.

                <p class="text-stone-600 mb-6">Unfortunately, dividend income isn't free. The IRS wants its share. The good news is that "qualified" dividends are often taxed at lower rates than your regular salary. This interactive chart helps you visualize the tax rates for 2024 based on your income and filing status.</p>
                <div class="prose max-w-none mb-6">
                    <p>There are two main types of dividends for tax purposes:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
                        <li><strong>Ordinary Dividends:</strong> These are taxed at your regular income tax rate, just like your job's salary.</li>
                        <li><strong>Qualified Dividends:</strong> To encourage long-term investing, these are taxed at lower capital gains rates. Most dividends from major U.S. companies are qualified, as long as you've held the stock for a certain period (usually more than 60 days).</li>
